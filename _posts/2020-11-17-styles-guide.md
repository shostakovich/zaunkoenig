**Zaunkönig** is the german name for [**wren**][1].

Zaunkönig is composed of the 2 words *Zaun* which means *Fence* and *König* which means *king*.

So Zaunkönig translates to "King of the fence".

## Zaunkönigs-Features (h2)

This page wants to illustrate how this theme looks.


### Lists (h3)
Ordered lists for example look like this.

1. Feather
2. Bird
3. King

Unordered lists like this

* König
* Zaun

> I am the king of the fence.

### Syntax-Highlighting (h3)
Not only the linux penguin but also the Zaunkönig likes code.

```ruby
# The king of the fence!

3.times do
  puts "I am the king of the fence"
end
```

By the way. You can enable Syntax hightlighting with `syntax_highlighting: true` in the front-matter.

Zaunkönig is a small bird.
